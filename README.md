How to use it? üöÄ

When you first launch SINISTER, you might be a little bit confused, especially if it's your first time doing roblox exploiting.
But don't worry, I will help you and guide you through!
Buttons
Our UI has 5 main buttons

INJECT -- Injects the selected script to the game
EXEC -- Executes the injected script
CLEAR -- Clears the script input
OPEN -- Opens a script. Use .txt or .lua files
SAVE -- Saves script in input

Then there are 3 other buttons:

USAGE -- Shows you this README
SUPPORT -- Invites you to our support server
RELOAD -- Reloads the Scripts folder


How do I add my own script(s)? üìÑ

If you want to add your own script(s), just paste or create a .txt or .lua file in the Scripts/ folder along with the executable.
Make sure the file contains the actual script.
If you don't see a Scripts folder, create one. Make sure it has capital S

Possible issues ‚ùó

Freezing or Crashing
If your game freezes or crashes, it's because your injected script is outdated, bugged or doesn't contain LUA script

Getting Banned
If you got banned from minigame, or your whole account got banned, it's because you used your script very obviously.


How to stay safe üåå

Don't make your scripts too obvious.
If you hop into let's say Arsenal game, and start spinning and one-tapping everyone, you're most likely getting banned.

Don't tell everyone that you're using scripts/executors
Do not tell in chat that you use scripts, do not show the executor/scripts on on example Discord Streams. Just try not to show it

Do not use random scripts
Always check the code by yourself, if it doesn't contain malicous code.
If you don't know coding and cannot read the source file, use our Script Hub or #scripts channel on our discord, or search on trustworthy sites/forums
